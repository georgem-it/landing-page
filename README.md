# landing-page
My first landing page, part of The Odin Project exercises

Made it according to their guide (how it's supposed to look), but added my own content and made a page about my girlfriend's cat.

This landing page was mainly an exercise in flexbox. The CSS file is a mess, and should be refactored in the future.
